      <h3>C# is the best coding language</h3>
      <p>Hi guys, I just wanted to share my thoughts. If you want the best combination of human readability and blazing fast speed, use C#. To print "Hello World" just type <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code>. It's 20 times faster than Python, and with Unity and Godot it's great for game dev!</p>

      <h3>Website Builders are just stupid</h3>
      <p>I know they make it easier, but I am not an HTML wizard. ChatGPT helped a lot with this site, mostly with JS. Not knowing how to code should never be a selling point for greedy useless companies. If you don't know HTML just ask for "a simple tutorial to add text in HTML and a blog layout".</p>
